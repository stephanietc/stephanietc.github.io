Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a systems-thinking strategist working in public policy. My approach to tackling complexity is drawn from nearly a decade of experience in biomedical engineering research. I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/).

I am a problem-solver at heart, and I enjoy a good challenge. In my research career, I have developed models of [speech](/research/auditoryfb) and [hearing](/research/soundloc), built creative [healthcare technologies](/research/biomusic), and investigated [ways](/research/auditoryfb) to make rehabilitation [fun and effective](/research/musicmaster). You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

 I have enjoyed working with multidisciplinary teams on exciting challenges in research, hospital, and non-profit environments. Currently, I am using my strengths in program planning and project management to develop strategy and policy for health data governance and privacy.
