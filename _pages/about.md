Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering and the Collaborative Program in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. I apply engineering approaches to the study of speech and hearing. I also work to harness people's interest in music and sound for health management and rehabilitation. My research interests include speech signal processing, brain stimulation methods, and computational models of speech and hearing.

Currently, I work with [Dr. Deryk Beal](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientists/dbeal), researching the development of speech motor control to understand how kids learn how to speak by listening to their own voices. Previously, I received my B.Eng in Electrical & Biomedical Engineering and my MASc in Electrical & Computer Engineering, both from McMaster University.

Science communication is also important to me; I ran the now-archived website [All About Kids Research](http://stephaniecheung.ca/allaboutkidsresearch/) with my colleague [Karolina Urban](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karolina_Urban). It was dedicated to sharing knowledge about paediatric health research in a meaningful and accessible format.
