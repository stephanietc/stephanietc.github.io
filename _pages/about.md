I am a systems-thinking strategist with a research lens working in public policy. As a policy advisor, I support executive decision-making with thoughtful analysis, drawing from my engineering and research backgrounds to develop elegant solutions for complex issues. I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/).

I am a problem-solver at heart, and I have enjoyed working on challenges with multidisciplinary teams in academic, healthcare, non-profit, and government sectors. In my research career, I have developed models of [speech](/projects/auditoryfb) and [hearing](/projects/soundloc), built creative [healthcare technologies](/projects/biomusic), and investigated [ways](/projects/auditoryfb) to make rehabilitation [fun and effective](/projects/musicmaster). You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

No matter the challenge, I match my firm belief in public sector innovation with a strong strategic skillset to serve the public interest.
