I am a systems-thinking strategist working in public policy. My approach to tackling complexity is drawn from nearly a decade of experience in biomedical engineering research, where solutions to thorny problems depend on strong evidence and clear analysis to support decision-making. I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/).

I am a problem-solver at heart, and I have enjoyed working on challenges with multidisciplinary teams in academic, healthcare, non-profit, and government sectors. In my research career, I have developed models of [speech](/projects/auditoryfb) and [hearing](/projects/soundloc), built creative [healthcare technologies](/projects/biomusic), and investigated [ways](/projects/auditoryfb) to make rehabilitation [fun and effective](/projects/musicmaster). You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

I am a firm believer in public sector innovation, and I am motivated by collaborative efforts to serve the public interest. Currently, I am using my strengths in corporate planning and project management to develop strategy and policy for health data governance.
