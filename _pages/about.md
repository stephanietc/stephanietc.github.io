I am a strategist, scientist, and former academic researcher in biomedical engineering. I enjoy the puzzle of understanding complex systems and trying to improve them.

I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) with a [collaborative specialization in neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and conducted my research at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/). In my academic career, I researched the role of sensory feedback in motor control, with focuses in speech development and paediatric rehabilitation. I studied models of [speech](/projects/auditoryfb) and [hearing](/projects/soundloc), built helpful [technologies](/projects/biomusic), and investigated [ways](/projects/auditoryfb) to make rehabilitation [fun and effective](/projects/musicmaster). You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).
