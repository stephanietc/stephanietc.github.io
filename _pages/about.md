Hi! My name is Stephanie, and I am a biomedical engineering researcher. Most recently, I defended my PhD dissertation in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I previously received my BEng in [Electrical & Biomedical Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece) and my MASc in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece), both from McMaster University.

I apply engineering approaches to the study of speech development in children. I have also worked to harness people's interest in music and sound for health management and rehabilitation. You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's 2017 #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

My research interests include speech signal processing and computational models of speech and hearing. In my work, I am motivated by critical and equitable approaches to open scholarship. I am also interested in advancing discussions about data ethics issues within healthcare and health research.

Research training is important to me. With collaborators, I have worked to develop comprehensive tools and programs to target research literacy and science communication in health researchers. I am grateful and excited to be part of an incredible community of researchers striving to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people all around the world.
