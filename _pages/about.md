Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering and the Collaborative Program in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. Previously, I received my B.Eng in Electrical & Biomedical Engineering and my MASc in Electrical & Computer Engineering, both from McMaster University.

I apply engineering approaches to the study of speech development in children. I have also worked to harness people's interest in music and sound for health management and rehabilitation. You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's 2017 #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

My research interests include speech signal processing, brain stimulation methods, and computational models of speech and hearing. I am also driven to explore and advocate for critical and equitable approaches to open scholarship in health research, and am particularly interested in investigating the intersection of those areas with data ethics policy in healthcare.

I have also worked to develop comprehensive training practices targeting capacity-building in health researchers. I am grateful and excited to be part of an incredible community of researchers striving to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people all around the world.
