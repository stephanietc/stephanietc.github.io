Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering and the Collaborative Program in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. Previously, I received my B.Eng in Electrical & Biomedical Engineering and my MASc in Electrical & Computer Engineering, both from McMaster University.

I apply engineering approaches to the study of speech development in children. I have also worked to harness people's interest in music and sound for health management and rehabilitation. My research interests include speech signal processing, brain stimulation methods, and computational models of speech and hearing.
