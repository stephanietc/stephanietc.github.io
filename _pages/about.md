Hi! My name is Stephanie, and I am a biomedical engineering researcher. I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/).

My career reflects a lifelong affinity for solving challenges big and small. I develop models of speech and hearing, build creative healthcare technologies, and investigate ways to make rehabilitation fun and effective. You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

I believe that the goal of good research is action, so scientific evidence should be transparent and accessible. Collaboration is key to data-driven discovery, and informed discussions about data ethics and privacy are absolutely critical. I am excited to take part in these conversations with an incredible community of researchers and practitioners striving to make a meaningful difference in the world.
