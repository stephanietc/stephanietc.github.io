I am a strategist, scientist, and former academic researcher in biomedical engineering. I treat complex systems as intriguing puzzles to understand, explain, and solve.

I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) with a [collaborative specialization in neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and conducted my research at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/). As an academic, I researched the role of sensory feedback in motor control, with focuses in speech development and paediatric rehabilitation. I studied models of [speech](/projects/auditoryfb) and [hearing](/projects/soundloc), built technologies for [clinical settings](/projects/biomusic), and developed ways to make therapy [fun and effective](/projects/musicmaster). You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

I am also interested in the reliability and [validity](/projects/audaptervalidation) of measures, both those that are used in research and those that we encounter day to day. How can we be certain that a tool fully measures the construct it's meant to, and how consistently can it be applied? How do these measures impact what we think we know about a system?

Now that I've left academia, I ask similar questions as I tackle complex systems of a different kind -- trustworthy public sector policies and programs. I make design and delivery more effective and efficient by asking questions, gathering evidence, and creating principles-based tools for implementation. From a scientific lens, the work isn't so different from developing conceptual models and fast-tracking them into testing, iterating and improving for the benefit of the user.

This website showcases my academic portfolio and will give you a sense of how I find creative, elegant solutions for tricky problems.
