I am a strategist and scientist with an engineering research background. I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) with a [Collaborative Specialization in Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and conducted my research at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/). My research interests include motor learning, sensorimotor feedback integration, speech signal processing, and motivation in therapeutic intervention, particularly in children.

In my research career, I studied models of [speech](/projects/auditoryfb) and [hearing](/projects/soundloc), built creative [healthcare technologies](/projects/biomusic), and investigated [ways](/projects/auditoryfb) to make rehabilitation [fun and effective](/projects/musicmaster). You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

While I no longer work in academia, I use many similar skills in my current work to make systems and services more effective and efficient. This website showcases my old academic portfolio. Feel free to take a look around!
