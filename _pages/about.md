Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a biomedical engineering researcher and a problem-solver at heart. I earned my PhD in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto and [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/).

My career reflects a lifelong affinity for asking big questions and tackling complex challenges. In my research, I have developed models of speech and hearing, built creative healthcare technologies, and investigated ways to make rehabilitation fun and effective. You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/).

I believe that the goal of good research is action. To achieve action, science must be transparent, accessible, and equitable. Collaboration is key to data-driven discovery, and informed discussions about data ethics and privacy are absolutely critical. I am excited to take part in these conversations with an incredible community of researchers and practitioners striving to make a meaningful difference in the world.
