Hi! My name is Stephanie, and I am a biomedical engineering researcher. I evaluate and apply scientific methods to develop computational models for human processes like speech and hearing. Previously, I have worked on projects to harness our natural interests in music and sound for health management and rehabilitation. You may have read about my work in [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/), heard it mentioned on the podcast [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/), or seen me featured in [hEr VOLUTION's #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign](https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/). In my work, I am motivated by critical approaches to open research, knowledge translation, and data ethics.

Most recently, I defended my PhD dissertation in [Biomedical Engineering](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/) and [Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. During my PhD, I applied engineering approaches to the study of speech development in children. I previously received my BEng in [Electrical & Biomedical Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece) and my MASc in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece), both from McMaster University.

Research is a team effort, and knowledge sharing is important to me. With collaborators, I have developed [comprehensive tools and training programs](http://dx.doi.org/10.22230/src.2019v10n3a337) to build research literacy and science communication. I am grateful and excited to be part of an incredible community of researchers striving to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people all around the world.
