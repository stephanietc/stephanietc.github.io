## Thanks
Thanks for your patience while I worked out the logistics of hosting a virtual defense. It's strange to proceed with this milestone under the current circumstances, but I'm glad for the opportunity to have you join me online. I hope that you are all safe and well, and that you're able to prioritize the health and wellbeing of yourselves and your communities.

I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'll wrap up the last few years without a proper chance to say goodbye to so many of you. Please know that I am grateful to all of you for your generous support throughout my time at Holland Bloorview and the University of Toronto. To the Holland Bloorview crew and to my mentors, especially: You know better than anyone that this PhD has been a team effort. Thank you for the hours that you've poured into helping me and for every kind word along the way.

I hope that I'll get to see each and every one of you soon. Stay safe and take care.

Steph
