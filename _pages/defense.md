## Thanks
Thanks for your patience as I work out the logistics of hosting a virtual defense. It's strange to proceed with this milestone under the current circumstances, but I'll keep this page updated with the latest information about the event. I hope that you are all keeping safe and well, and that you're able to prioritize the health and wellbeing of yourselves and your communities.

I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'll wrap up the last few years without a proper chance to say goodbye to so many of you. Please know that I am grateful to all of you for your generous support throughout my time at Holland Bloorview and the University of Toronto. The work that I am presenting truly would not have been possible without your help and encouragement. To the Holland Bloorview crew and to my mentors, especially: Thank you for the hours that you've poured into helping me problem-solve, for letting me crash your desks and offices, and for every kind word along the way.

I hope that I'll get to see each and every one of you soon. Stay safe and take care.

Steph
