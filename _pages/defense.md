## Thanks
Thanks for your patience as I work out the logistical details of hosting a virtual defense. I hope that you are all keeping safe and well.

It's strange to wrap up the last few years without a chance to say a proper goodbye in person to so many of you. Please know that I am grateful to all of you for your generous support throughout my time at Holland Bloorview and the University of Toronto. The work that I am presenting truly would not have been possible without your help and encouragement. To the Holland Bloorview crew and to my mentors, especially: Thank you for the hours that you've poured into helping me problem solve, for letting me crash your desks and offices, and for every kind word along the way.

I hope that I'll get to see each and every one of you soon. Stay safe and take care.
