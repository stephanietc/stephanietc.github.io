{"name":"Stephanie T. Cheung","tagline":"PhD Student, Biomedical Engineering & Neuroscience","body":"## About Me\r\nHi! My name is Stephanie. I'm a PhD student in [Biomedical Engineering](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) and the [Collaborative Program in Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I do my research at the [Bloorview Research Institute](http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/BRIHome), creating and evaluating fun, home-based rehabilitation therapies to improve motor control in children with cerebral palsy. To design these interventions, I am merging principles in music-supported rehabilitation and video game therapy. My advisors are [Dr. Joyce Chen](http://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?m=509&page=172) and [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientist/Elaine-Biddiss).\r\n\r\n## Some Past Projects\r\nPhysiological Models of Impaired Hearing (2012 - 2014)\r\n* With [Dr. Ian Bruce](http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce), I used computational models of the auditory brainstem and midbrain to investigate sound localization with and without the use of hearing aids. You can read more in [my thesis](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/16032)\r\n\r\nBiomusic (2010)\r\n* [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientist/Elaine-Biddiss), [Elizabeth Han](http://elizabethhan.com), and I created an auditory interface that allows children with profound disabilities to communicate anxiety. We mapped several physiological indicators of anxiety to sound, creating lively \"biomusic\".
