New article alert! My PhD work has been published in JASA. Huge thanks to wonderful colleagues at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](http://hollandbloorview.ca/) and the [Institute of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.utoronto.ca/) for their contributions on my study team.

The evidence from our research indicates that the role of auditory feedback in speech motor control changes with age. We've demonstrated how to probe further using circular statistics in 2-D formant space. I am excited about this work and very happy to share it.
