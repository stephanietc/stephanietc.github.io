title:  "I've completed my PhD!"
---

I've completed my PhD! I am so grateful to amazing colleagues, friends, and mentors at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](http://hollandbloorview.ca/) and the [Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.utoronto.ca/) for their support during this journey. My (entirely virtual) defense was a lot of fun, and I was glad for the chance to share a celebratory moment with supporters during the public webinar. Now that my final dissertation has been submitted to the University of Toronto, I am excited to embark on new post-PhD adventures!
