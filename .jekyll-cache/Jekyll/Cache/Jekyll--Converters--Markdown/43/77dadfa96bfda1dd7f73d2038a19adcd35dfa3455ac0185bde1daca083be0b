I"‡<p>I am a systems-thinking strategist with a research lens working in public policy. As a policy advisor, I support executive decision-making with thoughtful analysis, drawing from my engineering and research backgrounds to develop elegant solutions for complex issues. I earned my PhD in <a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/">Neuroscience</a> at the University of Toronto and <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>I am a problem-solver at heart, and I have enjoyed working on challenges with multidisciplinary teams in academic, healthcare, non-profit, and government sectors. In my research career, I have developed models of <a href="/projects/auditoryfb">speech</a> and <a href="/projects/soundloc">hearing</a>, built creative <a href="/projects/biomusic">healthcare technologies</a>, and investigated <a href="/projects/auditoryfb">ways</a> to make rehabilitation <a href="/projects/musicmaster">fun and effective</a>. You may have read about my work in <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/">Smithsonian Magazine</a>, heard it mentioned on the podcast <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/">99% Invisible</a>, or seen me featured in <a href="https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/">hEr VOLUTIONâ€™s #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign</a>.</p>

<p>No matter the challenge, I match my firm belief in policy innovation with a strong strategic skillset to serve the public interest.</p>
