<p>Working with <a href="https://hollandbloorview.ca/staff/elaine-biddiss-masc-phd">Dr. Elaine Biddiss</a>, I used machine learning to classify musical instruments from audio mixtures. In <a href="/projects/musicmaster/">mixed-reality video games for music therapy</a>, these algorithms can be paired with camera tracking to detect and reward the motions of music-making. These movements may be missed by camera tracking alone.</p>
