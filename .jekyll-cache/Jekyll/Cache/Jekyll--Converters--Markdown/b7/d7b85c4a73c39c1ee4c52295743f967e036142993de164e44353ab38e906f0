<p>With colleagues at <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>, I established a cross-disciplinary journal club to build capacity in conceptual knowledge, critical appraisal, and research communication. We took an evidence-based approach to design, implementation, and evaluation, and found that attendees were highly satisfied with their ability to meet their learning goals through the pilot program.</p>
