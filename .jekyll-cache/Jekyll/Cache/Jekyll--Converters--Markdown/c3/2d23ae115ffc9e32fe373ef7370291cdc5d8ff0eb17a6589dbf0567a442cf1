I"5<p>New article alert! Pleased to share that my colleagues at <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a> have published an overview of our efforts to create a cross-disciplinary journal club in a teaching hospital. In this paper, we share our process of design, implementation, and evaluation. I hope researchers at other institutions will find this contribution helpful when considering how best to share knowledge across teams.</p>
