I"~<p>I am a strategist with a science and engineering research background. I earned my PhD in <a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/">Neuroscience</a> at the University of Toronto and <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>. While I no longer work in academia, I use many similar skills in my current work to make systems and services more effective and efficient.</p>

<p>In my research career, I developed models of <a href="/projects/auditoryfb">speech</a> and <a href="/projects/soundloc">hearing</a>, built creative <a href="/projects/biomusic">healthcare technologies</a>, and investigated <a href="/projects/auditoryfb">ways</a> to make rehabilitation <a href="/projects/musicmaster">fun and effective</a>. You may have read about my work in <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/">Smithsonian Magazine</a>, heard it mentioned on the podcast <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/">99% Invisible</a>, or seen me featured in <a href="https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/">hEr VOLUTIONâ€™s #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign</a>.</p>
