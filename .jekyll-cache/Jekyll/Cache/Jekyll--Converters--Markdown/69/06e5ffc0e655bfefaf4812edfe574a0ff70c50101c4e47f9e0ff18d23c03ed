I"J<p>Two years ago, on June 2nd, 2020, I sat on the couch to watch my virtual convocation. It was an anticlimactic end to an anticlimactic PhD; I had defended a week after the start of the first pandemic lockdown, lecturing to a camera from home while my examiners questioned me off-camera from theirs. “Finally done - I shouted into the void for 3 hours straight and got a degree out of it,” I said to a friend when it was over. It really wasn’t the celebratory event I’d imagined.</p>

<p>In the two years that have passed since I accumulated those three letters - PhD - I’ve largely focused on moving past an academic research career that no longer appeals to me. But recently, someone asked me if I miss the “research life” I left behind. The answer, truthfully, has always been “no”. but now I realize it’s because I’ve never had to give up the things I loved about research:</p>

<p>In my new “policy life”, I do my fair share of fact-finding. Between environmental scans and consultations - and, yes, academic literature searches - I still enjoy the thrill of new information to explore, new leads to add to my growing checklist. When I pull it all together to create a thoughtful, informed policy proposal, I get to do the evaluation, analysis, and systems-thinking that I’ve always likened to solving a challenging puzzle. And when I present recommendations to decision-makers, I get to do the knowledge translation and communication that I enjoy so much. What’s more: I’ve always loved doing research within a team, and policy work is inherently a team sport.</p>

<p>I joke about having a “research brain” sometimes, but I wouldn’t be where I am without it.</p>

<p>So, two years on, I’m quietly recognizing everything I love about my new career path, and thanking all the people who made me the researcher I am.</p>
