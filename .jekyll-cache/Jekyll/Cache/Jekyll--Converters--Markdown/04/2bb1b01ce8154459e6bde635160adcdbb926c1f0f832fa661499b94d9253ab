<p>As a strategist, my current focus is on health data governance and privacy policy. I research, analyze, and advise on strategy, applying my strengths in corporate planning and project management to develop feasible and implementable approaches. My personal approach is to foster an environment where teamwork comes easily, and where all contributions build towards a strong, evidence-based, collaborative whole.</p>
