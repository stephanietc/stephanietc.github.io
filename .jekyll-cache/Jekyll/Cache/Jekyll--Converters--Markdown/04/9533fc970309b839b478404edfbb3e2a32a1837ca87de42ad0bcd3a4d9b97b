<p>Academic research is an environment where firmly-established power dynamics leave trainees vulnerable to mistreatment, sometimes at the hands of senior researchers or advisors. As Co-Chair (and later, Past Chair) of the <a href="http://hollandbloorview.ca/research-education/bri-trainee-executive">Bloorivew Research Institute Trainee Executive</a> (BRITE), I advocated for strong, formalized measures to protect trainees who report conflicts, concerns, and incidents (e.g. in instances of harassment, bullying, exploitation by academic advisors, or when reporting ethical misconduct of a supervisor).</p>

<p>In collaboration with the Reserach Operations and Teaching &amp; Learning offices and with members of the BRITE team, I championed the development of an institutional policy to guide the reporting process for trainees.</p>
