I"‹<p>Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a systems-thinking strategist working in public policy. My approach to tackling complexity is drawn from nearly a decade of experience in biomedical engineering research. I earned my PhD in <a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/">Neuroscience</a> at the University of Toronto and <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>I am a problem-solver at heart, and I enjoy a good challenge. In my research career, I developed models of speech and hearing, built creative healthcare technologies, and investigated ways to make rehabilitation fun and effective. You may have read about my work in <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/">Smithsonian Magazine</a>, heard it mentioned on the podcast <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/">99% Invisible</a>, or seen me featured in <a href="https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/">hEr VOLUTIONâ€™s #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Having worked in research, hospital, and non-profit environments, I am now using my strengths in corporate planning, program management, and leadership to develop strategy and policy for health data governance and privacy.</p>
