I"‡<p>I am a strategist and scientist with an engineering research background. I build teams that transform systems and services to operate more effectively, using a user-centred design approach. I earned my PhD in <a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/">Neuroscience</a> at the University of Toronto and <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>I am a problem-solver at heart, and I have enjoyed working on challenges with multidisciplinary teams in different sectors. In my research career, I have developed models of <a href="/projects/auditoryfb">speech</a> and <a href="/projects/soundloc">hearing</a>, built creative <a href="/projects/biomusic">healthcare technologies</a>, and investigated <a href="/projects/auditoryfb">ways</a> to make rehabilitation <a href="/projects/musicmaster">fun and effective</a>.
