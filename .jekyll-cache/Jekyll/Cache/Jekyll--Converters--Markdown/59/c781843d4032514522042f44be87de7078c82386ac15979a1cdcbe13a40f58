<p>I am working with <a href="https://hollandbloorview.ca/staff/deryk-beal-phd-reg-caslpo-ccc-slp">Dr. Deryk Beal</a> to investigate speech development in children. We are interested in understanding the role of auditory feedback - the sound of our own voices - in this process. The sound of our own voices can tell us when we have made a mistake in our speech, but less is known about how this information helps us to learn the correct speech sounds when we are young. In this project, I investigate how younger and older kids correct for errors that are artificially added into their speech feedback. I have found that older kids are better able to make direct corrections, suggesting that the ability to integrate auditory feedback gets better as kids get older.</p>
