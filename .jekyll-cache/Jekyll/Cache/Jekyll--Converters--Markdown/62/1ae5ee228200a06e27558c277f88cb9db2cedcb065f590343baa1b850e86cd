I"Á<p>I was happy to talk to Smithsonian Magazine about <a href="/research/biomusic/">Biomusic</a>, an auditory interface designed to convey emotion through musical states. The article summarizes a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00401">Frontiers in Neuroscience</a> paper, in which my colleagues and I described our research into how Biomusic can help children with communication difficulties to express their anxiety to caregivers.</p>
