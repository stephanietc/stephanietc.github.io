<p>Through this project, my colleagues and I investigated speech development in children. We were interested in understanding the role of auditory feedback - the sound of our own voices - in this process. The sound of our own voices can tell us when we have made a mistake in our speech, but less is known about how this information helps us to learn the correct speech sounds when we are young. I investigated how younger and older kids correct for errors that are artificially added into their speech feedback, and found that older kids are better able to make direct corrections. This indicates that the ability to integrate auditory feedback gets better as kids get older.</p>
