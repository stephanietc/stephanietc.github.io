I"[<p>I was honoured to participate today in the <a href="https://www.engineeringleaders.ca/events/ninth-conference-on-the-leader-engineer">Ninth Conference on the Leader-Engineer</a> as an invited delegate. The day was full of rich conversations about workplace culture, change, and leadership potential. Iâ€™m always in awe of the research at the Institute for Studies in Transdisciplinary Engineering Education and Practice at the University of Toronto, and their commitment to transferable action is so important for Engineering and beyond. Huge thanks to the Troost ILEAD team for an amazing day!</p>
