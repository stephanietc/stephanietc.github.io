I"^<p>Iâ€™ve completed my PhD! I am so grateful to amazing colleagues, friends, and mentors at <a href="http://hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a> and the <a href="https://bme.utoronto.ca/">Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering</a> for their support during this journey. My (entirely virtual) defense was a lot of fun, and I was glad for the chance to share a celebratory moment with supporters during the public webinar. Now that my final dissertation has been submitted to the University of Toronto, I am excited to embark on new post-PhD adventures!</p>
