I"	<p>Hi! My name is Stephanie. I am a biomedical engineering researcher and a problem-solver at heart. I earned my PhD in <a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">Biomedical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.neuroscience.utoronto.ca/">Neuroscience</a> at the University of Toronto and <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>My career reflects a lifelong affinity for asking big questions and tackling complex challenges. In my research, I have developed models of speech and hearing, built creative healthcare technologies, and investigated ways to make rehabilitation fun and effective. You may have read about my work in <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-biomusic-offer-kids-autism-new-way-communicate-180968649/">Smithsonian Magazine</a>, heard it mentioned on the podcast <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/sound-and-health-hospitals/">99% Invisible</a>, or seen me featured in <a href="https://www.hervolution.org/150-days-canadian-women-stem-week-13-wrap/">hEr VOLUTIONâ€™s #CanWomenSTEM150 campaign</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that the goal of good research is action. To achieve action, science must be transparent, accessible, and equitable. Collaboration is key to data-driven discovery, and informed discussions about data ethics and privacy are absolutely critical. I am excited to take part in these conversations with an incredible community of researchers and practitioners striving to make a meaningful difference in the world.</p>
