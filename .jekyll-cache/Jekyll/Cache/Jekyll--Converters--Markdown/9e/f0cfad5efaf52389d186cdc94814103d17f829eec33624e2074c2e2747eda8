I"í<p>Two years ago, on June 2nd, 2020, I sat on the couch to watch my virtual convocation. It was an anticlimactic end to an anticlimactic PhD; I had defended a week after the start of the first pandemic lockdown, lecturing to a camera from home while my examiners questioned me off-camera from theirs. â€œFinally done - I shouted into the void for 3 hours straight and got a degree out of it,â€ I said to a friend when it was over. It really wasnâ€™t the celebratory event Iâ€™d imagined.</p>
