With colleagues at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/), I co-led the development of a cross-disciplinary journal club to build capacity in conceptual knowledge, critical appraisal, and research communication. We took an evidence-based approach to design, implementation, and evaluation, and found that attendees were highly satisfied with their ability to meet their learning goals through the pilot program.
