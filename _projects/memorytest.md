I developed a program that creates sets of stimuli meeting certain sequencing conditions for an N-back working memory test. This project supported a colleague's research to study the impact of brain stimulation on persistent post-concussion cognitive symptoms. While undergoing brain stimulation, participants in the research were assessed for their working memory performance using the memory test.
