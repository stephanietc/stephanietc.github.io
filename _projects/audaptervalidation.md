Real-time signal processing solutions can be used to manipulate a speaker's voice for experimental research. Researchers use this technology to understand the role of auditory feedback - the sound of our own voices - in speech motor control. In this project, I worked with colleagues to validate the function of a commonly-used software application that shifts children's vowels in real time.
