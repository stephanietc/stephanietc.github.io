With [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](https://hollandbloorview.ca/staff/elaine-biddiss-masc-phd) and researchers at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://hollandbloorview.ca/), I synthesized evidence of strategies for engagement in home-based video game therapies for children. This information helps therapists to help kids achieve their therapeutic goals in a motivating way.
