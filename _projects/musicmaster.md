With [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](https://hollandbloorview.ca/staff/elaine-biddiss-masc-phd) and [Dr. Joyce Chen](https://kpe.utoronto.ca/faculty/chen-joyce), I designed video games that allow children with cerebral palsy to access music therapy from home. By pairing motion tracking technology with music therapy techniques, these games are designed to enhance upper limb motor learning in a fun, engaging way.
