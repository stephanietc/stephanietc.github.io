![Validation of auditory perturbation software]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\projects\nserc-old.png)

Real-time signal processing solutions allow for a speaker's voice to be manipulated for experimental studies of speech-motor control. In this project, I am working with colleagues to validate the function of a commonly-used software application that shifts children's vowels in real time for auditory feedback perturbation research.
