![Auditory feedback in speech development]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\projects\nserc.png)

I am currently working with <a href="https://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientists/dbeal" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'LinkOut', 'Click', 'Beal');"> Dr. Deryk Beal</a>, researching how kids learn how to speak when they are young. We are interested in learning about the role of auditory feedback - the sound of our own voices - in this process.
