In academic research, extreme power differences can leave trainees vulnerable to mistreatment, particularly at the hands of senior researchers or advisors. As Co-Chair (and later, Past Chair) of the [Bloorview Research Institute Trainee Executive](http://hollandbloorview.ca/research-education/bri-trainee-executive) (BRITE), I advocated for strong, formalized measures to protect trainees who report conflicts, concerns, and incidents (e.g. in instances of harassment, bullying, and ethical misconduct).

In collaboration with the Research Operations and Teaching & Learning offices and members of the BRITE team, I contributed to the development of an institutional policy to guide the reporting process for trainees.
