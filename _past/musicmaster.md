With [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientist/Elaine-Biddiss) and [Dr. Joyce Chen](http://joycelchen.weebly.com/), I designed video games to allow children with cerebral palsy to access music therapy from home. By pairing motion tracking technology with music-supported rehabilitation therapy techniques, these therapies may enhance motor learning in a fun, engaging way.
