With <a href="http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientist/Elaine-Biddiss" target="_blank">Dr. Elaine Biddiss</a> and <a href="http://joycelchen.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Joyce Chen</a>, I designed video games to allow children with cerebral palsy to access music therapy from home. By pairing motion tracking technology with music-supported rehabilitation therapy techniques, these therapies may enhance motor learning in a fun, engaging way.
