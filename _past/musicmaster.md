With [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](https://hollandbloorview.ca/staff/elaine-biddiss-masc-phd) and [Dr. Joyce Chen](http://joycelchen.weebly.com/), I designed video games to help children with cerebral palsy to access music therapy from home. By pairing motion tracking technology with music-supported rehabilitation therapy techniques, these therapies are designed to enhance upper limb motor learning in a fun, engaging way.
