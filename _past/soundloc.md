![Sound localization]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\projects\project-2.png)

Sound localization is important for everyday listening. With <a href="http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce/" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'LinkOut', 'Click', 'Ian');"> Dr. Ian Bruce</a> at McMaster University, I used computational models of the auditory brainstem and midbrain to see how sound localization cues are processed in impaired and aided hearing.
