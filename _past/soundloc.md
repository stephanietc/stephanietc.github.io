![Neural models of sound localization]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\projects\project-2.png)

Sound localization is important for everyday listening. With [Dr. Ian Bruce](http://www.ece.mcmaster.ca/~ibruce/) at McMaster University, I used computational models of the auditory brainstem and midbrain to see how sound localization cues are processed in impaired and aided hearing.
