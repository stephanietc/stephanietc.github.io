With [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](https://hollandbloorview.ca/staff/elaine-biddiss-masc-phd) and colleagues at [Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital](https://hollandbloorview.ca/), I developed an auditory interface that helps children with communication disabilities to express their anxiety to caregivers. Our team transformed physiological indicators of anxiety into sounds, creating lively "biomusic" that lets you hear anxious feelings in musical changes. In our research, we found that our system performs with high accuracy (81%).
