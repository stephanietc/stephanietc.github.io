With [Dr. Elaine Biddiss](http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientist/Elaine-Biddiss) and [Elizabeth Han](http://elizabethhan.com/), I evaluated an auditory interface to help caregivers detect anxiety in children with communication difficulties. We mapped physiological indicators of anxiety to sounds, creating lively "biomusic" that lets you hear anxious feelings in musical changes.
