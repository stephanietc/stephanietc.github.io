![Music instrument classification]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\projects\project-1.png)

I used machine learning to detect and classify musical instruments from audio mixtures. In mixed-reality video games for motor therapy, these algorithms can complement motion tracking to detect and reward sounds associated with fine movements of music-making. These movements may be missed by motion tracking alone.
