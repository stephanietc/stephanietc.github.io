With <a href="http://research.hollandbloorview.ca/scientist/Elaine-Biddiss" target="_blank">Dr. Elaine Biddiss</a>, I used machine learning to detect and classify musical instruments from audio mixtures. In mixed-reality video games for motor therapy, these algorithms will complement motion tracking to detect and reward sounds associated with fine movements of music-making. These movements may be missed by motion tracking alone.
